The data blocks of a file are maintained using index nodes or i-nodes. Each i-node will
contain information about the data blocks, and will include 5 direct pointers, 1 singly indirect
pointer, and 1 doubly indirect pointer. Each pointer will be 32 bits in size, and will indicate a
block number. It will also store a type field indicating whether the file is a regular file or a
directory, and file size in bytes. The i-nodes will be stored in Block-1 and Block-2, in
increasing order of their numbers (i.e. i-node-0 first, followed by i-node-1, and so on).
